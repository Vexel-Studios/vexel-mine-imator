# Vexel Studios Mine-Imator
Welcome to **vexel-mine-imator**! This is a fork of the original [Mine-imator Community Build](https://github.com/Swooplezzz/Mine-Imator-Community-Build), customized and maintained by Vexel Studios to suit our specific animation needs.

## ðŸš€ Introduction
**vexel-mine-imator** is a version of the Mine-imator Community Build, designed to streamline our animation process with a bunch of new features. We encourage all members of Vexel Studios to transition to this version to ensure consistency and compatibility across all our animation projects.

## ðŸ’¬ Community and Support
If you have any questions or need further assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out to the project maintainers or drop a message in our [Vexel Studios Discord](https://discord.vexelstudios.com/).

## ðŸŒŸ Acknowledgements
